# Real-time-trading-platform

The scope of this project is in the Fintech industry, focusing on developing a real-time trading platform. Investors can buy and sell stocks while receiving in-depth analysis based on the company's financial reports, the latest market news, and the stock's performance. The platform is tailored for retail investors, brokers, and financial professionals to assist with trading, portfolio management, and stock performance evaluation.
Accomplishments:
● SQL scripts were created to handle critical database operations: ○ Clearing all tables (sql_scripts/reset.sql)
○ Inserting dummy data for testing (sql_scripts/init.sql)
● Backend Development:
○ A Node.js backend was set up with POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE routes to interact with the SQL database.
○ Routes were thoroughly tested using Postman to ensure proper insertion, retrieval, updating, and deletion of data.
● Frontend Integration:
○ We used HTML and Vanilla JavaScript for our front-end
implementation.
○ HTTP requests were made to our backend using JavaScript’s built-in
fetch API to perform CRUD operations on our Oracle database.
● Successfully implemented an Oracle database connection pool
● Developed SQL queries to perform essential database operations (registering
users, updating investor details, fetching data, etc.)
● Complex requirements (aggregation, group operations, and joins, etc.)
